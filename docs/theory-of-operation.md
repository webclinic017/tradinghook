# INTRODUCTION

"tradinghook" is a Flask based application that is designed to "catch" hooks and then place trades based on the alert. I am balancing what I have in GITHUB with what I have in production. My Production version isn't perfect yet... in fact it is scary because I have used it to place trades.


## INSTALLATION

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/tlh45342/tradinghook.git
````

## Theory of operation

AS of 10/17/2021 I am dropping more of my code in to at least get it to work with Webull again.
Note:  Webull papertrade accounts do not fully support all trade options like OCO.
Working on getting Ameritrade opertional.  I realize I will need to provide some setup instructions for this as I do not believe this is straight forward.
Will take a look at getting Alpaca up and running.  Note Alpaca accounts last I checked are all "margin" accounts.
